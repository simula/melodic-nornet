Description:    The vision of the MELODIC project is to enable federated cloud
                computing for data-intensive applications, and provide the user
                with an easy-to-use unified cloud environment, hiding the
                complexity of a multi-cloud. The MELODIC platform will enable
                big data and data-intensive applications by transparently
                taking advantage of distinct characteristics of available
                private and public clouds, dynamically optimise resource
                utilisation, consider data locality, conform to the userâ€™s
                privacy needs and service requirements, and counter vendor
                lock-in. From the perspective of the user, the MELODIC
                framework will appear as an infrastructure-agnostic
                middleware platform supporting development, deployment,
                and execution of data-intensive applications on distributed
                and heterogeneous multi-clouds.
